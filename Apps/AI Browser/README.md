# AI Browser
AI Browser is an experimental Swift-based web browser that explores how artificial intelligence can reshape the way we interact with the internet. Built and refined in Swift Playgrounds, it’s designed to navigate, interpret, and summarize the web — not just display it. Most of the code and text were AI-generated, guided by human direction and curiosity. It’s a creative experiment in AI-driven browsing, built by vibes, refined by people, and powered by pure exploration.

# Installation
To use the AI Browser, download the `.zip` file from the repository and extract its contents. Import the extracted files into **Swift Playgrounds,** or open the included `.playground` or `.xcodeproj` file located within the extracted folder. Once opened, the project can be executed directly to initialize and run the AI Browser environment.
