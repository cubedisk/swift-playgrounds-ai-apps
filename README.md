# Swift Playgrounds Projects
This repository is a collection of Swift apps and experiments we’ve built using Swift Playgrounds on iPad.
It’s where we test ideas, learn by doing, and see what’s possible with Swift in a hands-on, creative way.

Some projects are small demos or code experiments, while others are more complete mini-apps. Every one of them started as a way to explore something new — whether that’s a bit of Swift syntax, a UI concept, or just a random idea worth coding.

A few parts of the content were created or assisted by AI tools, but everything here was shaped, tested, and refined by us.

# About This Repository
We started this repository to document our progress, share what we’ve learned, and keep all our Swift Playgrounds in one place.
It’s a mix of fun experiments, educational code, and creative tinkering — all built directly on iPad.

We hope it might be useful or inspiring to others who are learning Swift or experimenting with Playgrounds themselves.
