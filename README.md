# Swift Playgrounds Projects
Welcome to our collection of Swift Playgrounds projects, all generated and refined by AI, including the text you’re reading now.

This is a space built on automation, curiosity, and pure digital creativity. There were no predefined plans, just prompts, patterns, and vibes — a true experiment in what happens when machines take the wheel in Swift development.

Everything here is completely vibe-coded — guided only by creative direction.
(Yes, there are real people behind this — we just let the AI do most of the typing.)

# About This Repository
This repository exists to explore and document what happens when Swift Playgrounds meets AI creativity. Every app, snippet, and experiment here was made through AI generation and refined within the iPad environment.

It’s a mix of experiments that range from working mini-apps to chaotic curiosities. Each one captures a moment of AI-driven exploration — an algorithm following patterns, logic, and occasionally, pure vibes.

We oversee the process, refine the results, and sometimes even try to understand what the AI was thinking. It’s all part of the fun!
